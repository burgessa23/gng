manufacturing, social media marketing and event production. She started her career
in fashion working on the sales floor of a retail store and was later promoted to store
manager. Her experience includes five years of fashion show production for Seattle's
Fashion First runway show, which later led to the launch of her style blogs, Seattle
Boutique Blogspot and Sydney Loves Fashion. After pursuing two degrees in Fashion
Marketing, Sydney went on to explore the corporate side of the fashion industry and

lines at Zumiez Inc. Her work has taken her all over the world including New York,
London, Paris China, Vietnam and Hong Kong. Sydney is well-versed on industry trends

					<h1>TESTIMONIALS</h1>
					<p class="quote">
						"I cannot say enough about Sydney - both as a person and as a talented business woman.
Sydney and I have worked together on multiple projects from Fashion First to Fashion
Group International and each time her professionalism and knowledge shine through.
I have hired her to build marketing plans and social media strategies for many of my
events and they have all been executed with great success.   Sydney is simply the best at
what she does."</p>
<p class="auth">- Audrey Clark, Little Black Dress Events & Productions</p>
<p class="quote">
"Sydney helped us put some controls in place for our development/production process
and build some procedures to help grow the company. At the same time she helped me
directly with filling an open position for Project Manager. Sydney has great experience
and is full of valuable input."</p>
<p class="auth">- Dustin Winegardner, ITC Accessories</p>
<p class="quote">
"Sydney's leadership skills are evidenced by her effective and diplomatic rebuilding of
the Seattle Chapter of Fashion Group International while serving as Regional Director.
She energized the group, refocused its purpose and added members to a chapter that
had dwindled in numbers and purpose during the recent economic downturn.  Through
Fashion Group International, Sydney has met and connected with Fashion Executives in
major US cities including New York, Los Angeles, Seoul, London and Paris."</p>

"Sydney is a pleasure to work with. It is amazing how many projects she can work on at
one time, without diluting her efforts in any one area. Her ability to multi-task and her
exceptional people skills make her a force to be reckoned with!"</p>

<p class="quote">
"Sydney has been a fantastic coach for our store when it comes to social media. She
worked with one of my employees to create a strategy for Facebook, Twitter and
Pinterest and is completely knowledgeable in all of these areas. I've learned a lot from
her in the process. As a result of working with Sydney, our Facebook traffic has grown
by leaps and bounds. Many people tell us that it’s one of the best fan pages in retail.
(I have to say-I think so too!) I wish I could have her on board every week to take
over all of our social media projects. When I read her blog, I am just amazed at how
knowledgeable and great she is at this. I would highly recommend Sydney for any social
media projects or initiatives you may have. Doing this type of marketing has definitely
increased our store visibility."</p>

<p class="quote">"If you need something done, Sydney is your go-to girl! I've worked with Sydney on
several projects and each time has been an absolute pleasure. She not only makes things
happen, but she's also extremely passionate about what she does. I was honored to have
her be part of Fashion Camp by Rosaline Hampton and she went above and beyond all
my expectations. Fashion Camp wouldn't have been the same without her efforts. You
can always look forward to great ideas and amazing work when Sydney is involved!"</p>
